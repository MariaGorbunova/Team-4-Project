# Team-4-Project_Data_Structures

This project was done for Data Structure course at De Anza college. 

Having a database of iPhones with IMEI and other data the program reads it from a file (.txt),
writes it down in two Binary Search Trees and a hash table. In order to traverse and list data in a certain order,
using primary and secondary keys were written algorythms for two BSTs. 

The Hash table algorythm that was written for this program uses linked list for overloads. It is used for retrieving info.
